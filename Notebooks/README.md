# Instructional Notebooks

This directory contains the hands-on instructional notebooks used in **BIFX-546: Machine Learning for Bioinformatics**.

Each notebook is designed to support specific learning objectives and to reinforce concepts introduced in the textbook and lectures through practical, executable examples.

## How to Use These Notebooks

- Notebooks are intended to be run **top-to-bottom** in Google Colab.
- Students are encouraged to read the corresponding textbook chapters first.
- Use the notebooks to:
  - Explore concepts through code
  - Modify examples and observe outcomes
  - Add notes, comments, and questions for discussion

## Notebook Organization

- Notebooks are ordered to reflect the progression of topics in the course.
- Later notebooks build on concepts introduced earlier.
- Each notebook includes explanatory Markdown, code walkthroughs, and discussion prompts.

## Relationship to Course Projects

The techniques demonstrated in these notebooks are intended to support the course project milestones defined in the `/course-docs/` directory. Students should use these notebooks as references when developing their own analyses and models.

These notebooks are instructional resources and starting points—not complete solutions.
