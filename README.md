# BIFX-546
Machine Learning for Bioinformatics

This repository contains course notebooks, examples, and supporting materials for BIFX-546.

Instructor: Sarangan "Ravi" Ravichandran

The course is primarily based on:

Joel Grus, Data Science from Scratch, 2nd Edition, O’Reilly Media, Inc.

The original concepts, structure, and examples from the book have been expanded and adapted for instructional use. In particular, this repository includes:
	•	Detailed explanations and annotations to support learning
	•	Additional examples beyond those in the textbook
	•	Code adaptations designed for clarity and pedagogical use
	•	Conversion of Python examples into ready-to-run Google Colab notebooks, requiring no local setup

These materials are intended to complement the textbook, not replace it. Students are expected to read the corresponding book chapters alongside the notebooks in this repository.

📌 Usage and Attribution

All materials in this repository are provided for educational use only.
Any modifications, extensions, or instructional adaptations beyond the original textbook and code examples are the responsibility of the course instructor.

🧭 How to Use This Repository

The notebooks in this repository are adapted from the examples presented in Data Science from Scratch (2nd Edition) and have been implemented in Google Colab for ease of use. In addition to making the code readily executable, the notebooks include:
	•	Detailed explanations of key concepts
	•	Step-by-step walkthroughs of how the code works
	•	Additional comments and annotations to clarify implementation details
	•	Minor adaptations to improve readability and instructional flow

Students are encouraged to read the corresponding textbook chapters first, and then use these notebooks to reinforce understanding through hands-on practice and experimentation.
